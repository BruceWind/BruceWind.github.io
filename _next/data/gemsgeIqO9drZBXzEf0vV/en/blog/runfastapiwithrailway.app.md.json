Your main file: **app.py** should have this code:\n\n``` python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\nasync def root():\n    return {\"message\": \"Hello World\"}\n```\n\n2. your **railway.json** file:\n\n``` JSON\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://railway.app/railway.schema.json\",\n  \"build\": {\n    \"builder\": \"NIXPACKS\"\n  },\n  \"deploy\": {\n    \"startCommand\": \"uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port \\\"$PORT\\\"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`uvicorn app:app` in above means `\"uvicorn {filename}:{variable name in file}`\n\nAnd you may need a `requirements.txt` file to help railway to install your dependencies.\n\n\nAfter all, you can open railway.app to create a project, and link to the github repo. It will work.\n\n","lang":"en"},"__N_SSG":true}
