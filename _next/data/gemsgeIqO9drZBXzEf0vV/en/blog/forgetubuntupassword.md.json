Download the Ubuntu ISO. In my case, I'm running Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS.\n\nCreate a bootable USB flash drive. Refer to the instructions on how to create a bootable USB drive.\n\nBoot into the Ubuntu bootable media. When prompted, select \"Try Ubuntu\". This will start the Ubuntu live session.\n\nOnce in the live session, launch the terminal.\n\nWe need to identify the root file system partition. The following command will list all the partitions in the system. The important part of the output is the last section, which contains a short partition table.\n\n``` shell\n\n$ sudo fdisk -l\n``` \nFrom the table, we determine that the boot partition is /dev/sda5. Now, install it by running this command.\n\n``` shell\n$ sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\n``` \nRun the next command to cross-install the contents from the live installation.\n\n``` shell\n$ for d in dev sys run proc; do sudo mount --bind /$d /mnt/$d; done\n``` \nNow, use chroot to become the root of the system.\n\n``` shell\n$ sudo chroot /mnt\n``` \nFinally, run the passwd command to change the root password.\n\n```  shell\n\n$ passwd\n``` \nOnce this process is complete, restart the system.\n\nPlease note that the above steps assume some prior knowledge of using the terminal and working with Ubuntu systems.\n\n\nThis article is copied from https://cn.linux-console.net/?p=16598 \n\nI had tested with this method to reset password.","lang":"en"},"__N_SSG":true}
