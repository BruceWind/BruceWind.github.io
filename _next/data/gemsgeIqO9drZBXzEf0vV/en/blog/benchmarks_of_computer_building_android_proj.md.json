You may see some low performance computers got a result as good as high performance CPUs. But if I open a chrome or other applications on those computers, spent time will be much longer, the test result on low performance computers would get a little bit slow. However, I must to say that Linux has its unique charatistic to faster a little.\n\nIn summary, even though result of high performance CPUs is not better than some low performance CPUs, high performance is still very important.
